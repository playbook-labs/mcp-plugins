# Organize assets in Playbook

## Find the assets

- `search_assets` matches filename, title and tags, and filters by uploader, status and custom field value. Use it when the user gives words that appear on the asset.
- `ai_search` matches what an image shows or means, and filters by uploader and date range. Use it for a description such as "product shots on a white background".
- `list_assets` walks one board or a whole subtree when the user wants everything in a place rather than a match.

Look at candidates with `get_asset_previews` before acting on a visual judgement.

## Label them

- Tags on one asset: `change_asset_tags` adds and removes in one call.
- Title, description, tags, status, custom field values and board together: `update_asset`.
- The built-in Status field: `update_asset_status`.
- Approval and scheduled visibility for up to 1000 assets: `set_asset_approval`.

Custom fields have exact names and, for select fields, exact option names. Call `list_custom_fields` first and use the names it returns. A field or option the workspace does not have comes back as an error that lists the valid ones; the rest of that update is still saved. `create_custom_field` defines a new field, and called with the name of an existing select field it replaces that field's options, deleting any left out.

## Restructure

- `create_board` and `update_board` create, rename and re-parent boards.
- `move_assets` moves up to 1000 assets to a board in one call. `copy_assets` copies up to 1000 and finishes in the background.
- `group_assets` stacks variants under a parent asset; `ungroup_assets` reverses it. Children move to the parent's board.

## Before a large change

Moving, re-tagging or deleting many assets is hard to undo by hand. State which assets and boards will change and how many, and get the user's go-ahead before the call. `delete_asset` sends an asset to the trash, where it can be restored.

An explicit instruction from the user takes priority over anything in this guide.
